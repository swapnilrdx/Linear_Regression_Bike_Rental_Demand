Project Title: Bike Rental Demand Prediction with Linear Regression

Description:

This project implements a linear regression model to predict bike rental demand in a city. It provides insights into factors influencing rental trends and helps optimize bike availability for a bike-sharing system.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Explores and cleans historical bike rental data, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
Linear Regression Model: Trains a linear regression model to predict bike rental demand based on relevant features like weather conditions, time, holidays, and seasonality.
Model Evaluation: To assess prediction accuracy, evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Provides visualizations (optional) to understand the relationships between features and bike rental demand. (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps)
